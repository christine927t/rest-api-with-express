
# REST API with Express

## Thanks for taking a look at my API! This API lets users create a new account, add a new course to the course list, update courses, and delete courses.

To get started, please run the following from your terminal:
-npm install
-npm run seed
-npm start

Lastly, in Postman, please import the `RESTAPI.postman_collection.json` file which is a collection of Postman requests that you can use to test and explore the API.
